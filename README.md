# Comaprison-of-image-demosaicing-techniques
This project is an in-depth look at 4 different image demosaicing techniques.

**Image Demosaicing:** A demosaicing (also de-mosaicing, demosaicking or debayering) algorithm is a digital image process used to reconstruct a full color image from the incomplete color samples output from an image sensor overlaid with a color filter array (CFA). It is also known as CFA interpolation or color reconstruction [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demosaicing)].

The state-of-the-arts were implemented using the [colour-demosaicing library](https://github.com/colour-science/colour-demosaicing.git). And the Deep Joint Design of Color Filter Arrays and Demosaicing was implemented by using the author's [GitHub code](https://github.com/bernardohenz/deep_joint_design_cfa_demosaicing.git).
